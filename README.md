# Isomera - AI Computational Chemist

The main bottleneck in drug discovery is human chemists with cultivated intuitions about proteins, drugs, and molecular dynamics. While tools like AlphaFold have scaled protein structure prediction to unprecedented levels—on the order of 10⁹ structures—human expertise cannot scale in the same way. We cannot simply multiply experienced computational chemists.

One proposed solution is to predict promising regions in chemical space. But in practice, that is not enough. Effective drug discovery still requires experts to interpret results, integrate diverse observations, and connect computational predictions with experimental data.

The core insight is that human judgment and intuition remain the true limiting factor. To truly scale drug discovery, we must amplify and extend this reasoning. Rather than only building better predictors, we aim to build intelligent agents that capture and scale expert knowledge—so we can scale insight itself, not just computation.
